# Exporting from Baselight via the Render View

This section uses the Bar Scene images provided in:

generalised\_colourspaces\_v01/0\_media/0\_images/BarScene

If you prefer to use your own images, you can. Even if you just read this section, it will allow you to understand the Render Panel.

Exporting from Baselight via the Render View

In this chapter, you learn how to export your images from Baselight using the Render View. If your images are going to appear on TV, in a cinema, or even just on a producer’s laptop, you need to export the files in a way that can be colour-accurately viewed by other people and other software packages. This section will show you how to manage that process.

This section will refer to the images that you created in the first chapter of this course. However, the instructions should apply easily to any scene.

In a previous section, you started to mark your timeline with markers \(remember those vertical red lines that flag events on the timeline\).

If the markers are not still visible on the timeline, please re-insert them by pressing L on the keyboard.

If you wish to delete markers and reinsert them, you can use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+L, which clears all markers. Use the L shortcut to reinsert a marker \(also notice that this shortcut is actually a toggle: if the cursor is parked on a marker, pressing L will also delete it\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Markers are also useful to specify frames that you need to render. In either camera test or dailies sessions, it is very normal to be asked to render single frames, also known as stills. These stills are often used as reference frames by the camera team.
{% endhint %}

Let’s do your first Baselight render. If you decided to experiment and create a completely new scene, please ensure that it contains markers.

You will now open the Render View.  
1. Go to the Views Menu and select Render or press Ctrl+R.

1. Take a few moments just to look at the Render View. It certainly does have a lot of options, but once you start to understand the logic it’s fairly simple.

Have you noticed the section that asks which Frames you want to render?

Image 85. First section of the Render panel.

Hopefully this should make sense. It’s either All Frames or specifically Selected Frames \(there is a drop- down menu where you see the words Select Frames\).

Now look at the row of tabs labelled Output. These refer to the types of files you want to output.

Image 86. First and second sections of the Render View. Here we are rendering just two frames, 489 and 1393.

We will eventually be outputting JPEG stills. For this reason, we would not choose Movies and we don’t have Audio, so the logical option is Sequences.

We will also need to select a Render Format and a Colour Space.

Image 87. Render View now with the Format and Colour Space added. Frames 489 and 1393 will be rendered as JPEG and as 1920x1080.

Take a few moments to familiarise yourself with the Render View. When you are ready, proceed to the next section.
