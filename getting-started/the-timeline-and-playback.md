# The Timeline and Playback



1 Your timeline is now assembled, so let’s take a look at how you can move between sequences.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Baselight we often use the term ‘sequence’ to refer to a shot. This term is derived from the sequence of images that make up a shot – whether it is a sequence of separate image files \(such as DPX or EXR sequences\) or a sequence of images contained within a movie file \(such as MXF or MOV\).
{% endhint %}

Remember during a Camera Test session, you will be under a lot of pressure to react to the client’s request to jump to different shots and takes.

2 **Ctrl+Click** \(or **Cmd+Click** on Linux\) on a thumbnail in the area that we call the **Cuts View** to take you directly to a shot. This puts the play-head \(cursor\) in the middle of the shot.

Please note that if you are working on Baselight STUDENT on a laptop, use a 3-button mouse to ensure you have access to all options in the software.
{% endhint %}

3 Other useful shortcuts to move around a timeline are Z and X on the keyboard – this will move you between shots.   
4 There are numerous ways to play a clip:   
• **Spacebar** will play the clip.   
• **Ctrl+Spacebar** \(or **Cmd+Spacebar**\) will play a clip in a loop. 

The transport controls on the Slate or Blackboard also allows you to navigate a timeline.

5 It is also very likely that the DOP will ask you to go to a given take on a given camera.

The best way to look at metadata in the timeline is to switch on metadata in the **Cutview**. **Right-Click** the Cutview and enable resolution and scene and take.

6 Practice **Ctrl+Clicking** \(Or **Cmd**\) to navigate - either with the mouse or Wacom pen. Practice playing a whole scene with **Shift+Spacebar** and **Ctrl+Spacebar** \(Or **Cmd**\) - this will toggle between playing the whole scene and the current shot only.
