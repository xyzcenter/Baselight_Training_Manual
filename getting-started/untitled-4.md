# Creating a New Project

Baselight v5 Training Manual

Getting Started

Before we begin, whilst the software is usable without them, if you wish to utilize the full capability of the Baselight system you will need a Three Button Mouse and a Full Keyboard with the Numeric Keypad. When these are needed it will be highlighted in the text but if you want to have full control it is recommended that you have both of these tools from this point.

This section uses the Bar Scene images provided in:

## Creating a New Project

Baselight v5 Training Manual

In this chapter you will learn about formats, creating projects, assembling a timeline, importing footage and learn how and why you need to choose appropriate Working Colour Spaces, Input Colour Spaces and Viewing Colour Spaces.

The aim of this section is for you to be able to set up a scene for a camera test, as well as run the camera test session with the DOP \(director of photography\) and the director.

1 Open Baselight.

Baselight icon on your desktop or in the Applications &gt; Baselight

folder, or, if on a Linux machine, open a terminal, type baselight and then press Enter.

The software will open with the Job Manager already visible. The Job Manager is where you can set up a ‘job’ \(a collection of Scenes\) and a ‘scene’ \(in Baselight, a ‘scene’ is a collection of shots — for example, rushes from a day’s shoot or a conformed commercial or drama – it does not necessarily relate to a scene in a script\). You can also access the Job Manager from the Scene menu at the top of the UI or by pressing Ctrl+J on the keyboard \(Cmd+J on Linux\).
