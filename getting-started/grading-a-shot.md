So far, we have a scene but it has no images. Now, look at the Baselight timeline and you will see a vertical blue line. This is the cursor. You can have multiple cursors in one scene but for the moment we will just use one.
So, what is a cursor? It’s just a position on the timeline – just like a play head.
