Baselight v5 Training Manual

The aim of this section is for you to familiarise yourself with some of Baselightâ€™s grading tools. You will do a basic exposure \(brightness\) match between shots using the Film Grade. You will also be introduced to printer lights/bumps or exposure bumps.

This section uses your scene from the previous section.
