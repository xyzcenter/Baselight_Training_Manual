Dailies and Creating a Deliverable

This chapter will teach you how to set up a Dailies scene. It will build on your knowledge of formats and it will show you how to activate Masks and Burnins.

What are Dailies?

Dailies refers to the process of getting the camera files from the day’s shoot into a format viewable by various member of the film crew and editorial staff.

Some of you may have worked on a dailies project and some students will have heard the term without understanding the process.

Dailies have been part of the film making process since, well, the beginning of film making.

In the past, when most features were shot on film, the raw, unedited footage captured during production was developed at night and printed onto film for viewing the next day by the director, director of photography, producers, actors and other key crew members. This provided a means of gauging how the picture was progressing in terms of the quality of performances, cinematography, etc.

The process of dailies has changed significantly over the years as it has been impacted by digital technology. However, the need for dailies remains the same. It lets film crews check what they have been shooting and to troubleshoot any technical issues. These may include mechanical issues with the camera, but also incorrect camera settings that may impact the quality of the images. For example, can you imagine shooting for two weeks only to discover that the camera was recording images in a compressed format, in spite of raw images being needed for post-production grading and effects.

There is another reason for dailies: dailies files are also produced so that the editorial team can start working. It’s sometimes not technically possible or viable for editing systems to work with raw camera data.

One of the first things that will happen when you start working on a dailies project is that you will be informed of the technical requirements of the files that you are delivering. This may be done via a short email, verbal instructions from a producer, or even a lengthy technical specification. Regardless of how, you will definitely be informed of the deliverable requirements. Your job is to ensure that the delivered files are technically correct.

Another important discussion between editorial and the dailies department is whether Burnins will be applied to an image and what information those Burnins should contain.

In today’s example, you will learn to render your images as movie files at a resolution of 1920x1080. Productions will often request this combo for use with editing systems. Your render will include a Mask \(blanking\) and a Burnin.

In previous sections, you learnt to render single frames. This time you will render whole sequences and you will also adhere to a fairly strict naming convention.
