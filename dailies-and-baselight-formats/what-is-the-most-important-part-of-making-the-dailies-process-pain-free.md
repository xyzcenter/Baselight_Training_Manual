# What is the Most Important Part of Making the Dailies Process Pain-free?

In order to be effective when creating dailies, you must fully understand formats and the Render Panel described elsewhere in this mahual. Dailies delivery has very exacting requirements and the turnaround is typically within 24 hours \(there is a reason they are also called rushes\).

For more information about formats and rendering, you can find the Baselight v5 User Guide on the FilmLight web site.

If a shoot takes place between 8am and 6pm and five cameras are rolling, there is likely to be a massive amount of data that needs to be processed.

Some readers will be aware that FilmLight has created specific software aimed at the dailies market, which is called Daylight. However, we are introducing the subject as part of the Baselight learning program as formats and the rendering procedure are nearly identical in both products.

So whether you are a user of Daylight or Baselight, let us now discuss some of the fundamentals that you need before you embark on a job.
