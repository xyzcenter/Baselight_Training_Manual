  Overview

  When you look at Base Grade you see that it consists of two sets of tabs.

The Balance control is repeated twice in the UI. If you drag the colour wheel towards red you see that the same value is shown on both tabs. The idea is that you have access to the Balance control irrespective of the tab you are using. However, if you donâ€™t feel you need the extra access you can of course choose another grading option.

So far, we have touched upon a few characteristics of Base Grade. We have mentioned that you can define zones in the image. You can for example, define which values should be considered Brights and Lights. Similarly, you can choose which values are Darks and Dims. All of these are definable via the pivots. The pivots can be adjusted manually by dragging the small green triangles or typing a value into the Pivot menus.

There are also some other very useful functions that are not available in the other grading tools. One new operation is Flare. Flare lets you choose where the blacks will sit in an image.
