# Timeline Marks

OK, let’s return to the scenario of the camera test \(and hopefully you have remembered to deactivate caching as it is not required at this point\). You have already matched the brightness of the shots roughly.

The DOP has now asked you to locate the two shots where the couple clink their drinking glasses. He wants to compare the sharpness of the two cameras.

What he or she doesn’t want to see is you playing endlessly through the timeline.

When a client wants us to just move between specific shots so that they can compare images, the Baselight markers become useful.

1. Move through your timeline and find the points in the clips where the couple’s glasses meet.

You can drag though the timeline by selecting the timeline cursor and dragging with your mouse or Wacom pen, or you can use the shuttle control on the Slate or Blackboard.

1. Make sure the cursor is located at the point of the glasses meeting, and press L on the keyboard to set a mark. If you are working on Blackboard or Slate, you can use the Marker button that resembles an I. A red vertical line will appear in the timeline.
2. Set markers on each shot where the glasses meet.

1. Jump between each marker by pressing Shift+Z/Shift+X on your keyboard, or use the appropriate controls on your Slate or Blackboard.

You would probably also be asked to zoom into the image if the DOP was interested in examining a certain area, such as details on a face.

1. To zoom into a face, place your cursor in the display area. If you are working with multiple screens to do this you can press Cmd+Shift+Escape. Note that zooming in on the image in this way does not have any effect on the rendered output.

   On Baselight STUDENT, press the Cmd key and drag left/right with the Middle Mouse Button.

2. If using a Blackboard or a Slate, press Ctrl and drag left/right with the Middle Mouse Button. If using a tablet, hold down the lower side-switch and drag left/right with the pen.
3. To reset the zoom, select the Display menu and choose Home Zoom or press F12 on the Keyboard.

   Let’s recap what you have learnt in this chapter. You have been reminded how you would create a new scene \(remember, it’s the scene that contains the important information such as resolution and Working Colour Space\) and you have learnt the basics of caching a scene. You have also learnt how to set marks and use them to navigate quickly in the timeline, and you have learnt how to zoom and reset the zoom of an image. You can also use these same functions in order to view the Timeline itself at different zoom levels.

   Please explore the Film Grade a little further by yourself. Start by looking at the contrast and saturation. In the next section, you will learn how to render the two frames that you have marked in the timeline.
