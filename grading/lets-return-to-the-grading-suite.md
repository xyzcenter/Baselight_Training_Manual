# Let’s Return to the Grading Suite

In a camera test, a Director of Photography \(DOP\) or the Director often tells a colourist to make the image brighter or darker – warmer or colder. You can answer all of these requests easily with the Exposure control in Film Grade.

1  Make the first shot warmer. To do this move the colour wheel or trackball in the Exposure control toward red.

2  In the next shot, you can make the image cooler by moving the colour wheel toward blue.

So, this is all correct – but it’s not exactly subtle.

Remember subtlety in a camera test is essential. Professionals such as Directors of Photography look at images continually. Their eyes are sharp. A frequent scenario in a camera test is that you would be asked to add a couple of points of a colour or a couple of points of brightness. You must understand how to be accurate. For this reason, it is useful to understand how to reconfigure the software to work with printer lights/exposure bumps.

3 Please reset each Film Grade that you have changed. To do this in Baselight STUDENT, go to each shot and press **Cmd+Fn+Backspace** or **Ctrl+Fn+Backspace** \(The reset command will reset the tool that is selected\).

If you are on Slate or Blackboard, press the reset buttons in the Film Grade. There are also R symbols available in the user interface. If you select one of the R symbols adjacent to a parameter that parameter will be reset.

Baselight v5 Training Manual

Configuring the Film Grade to work with printer lights is simple. How you access the printer lights/exposure bumps will depend on if you are working in Baselight STUDENT or if you have a Blackboard or Slate available to you.

If you are working in Baselight STUDENT and you wish to experiment with exposure bumps/printer lights, please attach an external keyboard so that you have a full numeric keypad available to you.
