# Accessing Layers and the Grading Tools

So, which grading tools will you need for a camera test?

Usually the DOP will ask to see the images without a grade. You would then be asked to match the shots as each different camera has its own characteristics. Normally this will just involve changing brightness and possibly saturation.

The main grading tools in Baselight are Base Grade, Film Grade and Video Grade.

As this chapter proceeds, we will look more closely at the Exposure setting in Film Grade. However, at this point you may have noticed that you can’t see Film Grade anywhere on the user interface.

You will find out more about the other grading tools in Baselight later on, in The Different Baselight Grading Tools on page 34.

Remember Baselight is different from other software in that to access Baselight’s grading tools, you must first add a grading layer. Grading tools become available to you once you add a new layer.

However, logically, before Layer 1 there is Layer 0.
