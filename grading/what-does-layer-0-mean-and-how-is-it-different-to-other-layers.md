# What does Layer 0 mean and how is it different to other layers?

Layer 0 doesn’t contain colour grading tools. It really contains just the controls and information relating to the input sequence. If, for example, you wanted to know where an image was located you would look at the information contained in Layer 0, specifically the File Name field as indicated in Image 01. You could also find information relating to resolution and colour space and also whether any kind of retime had been applied to a shot.

If you only have sequence strips in your timeline \(and a sequence strip is selected\), then you will have Layer 0.

No grading tools will be visible because in Baselight you must add a grading layer before you have access to the tools.

While you are first learning the software, keep in mind the very general premise that grading starts in Layer 1.

Ok, so now you know that you don’t really grade in Layer 0, let’s turn our attention to the grading layers.

1 To add a layer, make sure the cursor is located on the shot you wish to grade and choose Layer1 from the grading panel \(Slate or Blackboard\) or press P on the keyboard. You can also add a Layer by pressing the ‘+’ button in the Layer Manager.

This will add a layer to the shot you have selected in your timeline.

When you add a layer, controls will appear in the Parameters view – these are the controls for the currently selected grading operator. Take a moment to look at the user interface. You will see a column of grading options including Base Grade, Film Grade, Video Grade, Curve Grade and Hue Shift.

When you select a grading operator, the controls for that operator become active in the Parameters view to the left of the grid. So, if you select Video Grade you will see controls labelled Lift, Gamma, Gain. If you select Film Grade you will see controls relating to Exposure, Saturation and Contrast.

The controls are completely customisable but when you first open the software and access Film Grade you see two sets of tabs. On the first tab you see Exposure, Contrast and Saturation and on the second, Shadows, Midtones and Highlights.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

Each grading layer has a default grading operator defined in the layer preferences – this determines the grading controls which you will see when you first add the layer.

By default, when you add a new layer and before any grading changes have been made, the name of the operator is displayed in white. Once a change has been applied, the name of the operator turns blue.
