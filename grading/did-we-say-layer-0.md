# Did we say Layer 0?

If you have inserted the clips as we instructed in the previous section, Layer 0 and the information contained in it should already be visible on the user interface. You don’t have to add Layer 0 – it’s automatically associated with a clip as soon as you import it.

Take a quick look at the Baselight user interface. It should resemble something similar to the image above.
