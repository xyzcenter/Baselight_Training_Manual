Image 37. The Video Grade parameters. Lift has been reduced and gamma increased to add contrast to the image.

Video Grade is a popular tool with commercials colourists as it allows them to quickly set contrast. You may hear people talking about this as adding “punch” to an image.

For those of you who are new to colour grading, lift controls the shadow areas of the image, gamma, the midtones, and gain, the highlights.

1 As in the above image, move the lift control downwards and the gain up. The image immediately appears to have more contrast.

You will also notice that there are two separate tabs inside the Video Grade, RGB and Y’CbCr.

If you make the contrast change in the RGB tab the image will also start to look more saturated. If you do the same contrast change in the Y’CbCr tab you can affect the contrast without affecting saturation too much.

2 Reset the Video Grade: If you are using Baselight STUDENT, the shortcut for resetting all parameters is Cmd+Fn+BackSpace. If you are using a full Baselight system, use Ctrl+Backspace or Ctrl+Reset next to the grading ball on the left.

3.Now apply contrast in the Y’CbCr tab. Move lift down and gain upwards.  
4. Decide which look you prefer. If you preferred the effect of the contrast change in the RGB tab, press

Cmd+Z or Ctrl+Z until you return back that look.
